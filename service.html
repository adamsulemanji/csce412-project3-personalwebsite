                Service has always been such an important part of my life. I have always been involved in some sort of service organization. When I was a kid I was apart of <a href = "http://absolutelykaty.com/adam-sulemanji-earns-eagle-scout/" target = "_blank">Boy Scouts of America.</a>  
                I joined back in 2008 and over 12 years of scouting I have earned my Eagle Scout. Below is a picture of my troop hiking in Scotland and climbing the highest
                mountain in the UK,<a href = "https://goo.gl/maps/zovWPXV6ga9AfFHcA" target = "_blank">Ben Nevis</a>

                    Another organization that I have briefly mentioned was MSC FISH. I have been a member of this organization for over 3 years now starting off as an general member
                    within the day of development committee. Last year, I was the Assistant Director of Grants and Donations in the Outreach Committee. And finally this year I am one of two executive
                    directors of Development with my partner Jackie. Through MSC FISH, we have given back to the community in a wide variety of ways. We have helped out with the Brazos Valley Food Bank,
                    <a href = "https://www.destinationbryan.com/events/first-friday-event/" target = "_blank">First Friday</a>, Carly's Way and Soles for Souls just to name a few. MSC FISH also strives to put on events around the community our two biggest events include Run the Ramps and FLOBowl.
                    With my partner, Jackie we are in charge of putting on FLOBowl which is a powderpuff football game between the FLOs and a cheer competition between FLO guys.
