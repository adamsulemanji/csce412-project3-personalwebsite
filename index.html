                Howdy! My name is Adam Sulemanji, and I am a junior Computer Science Major from Katy, Texas. Believe it or not, computer science was not my major
                coming into college. I wanted to be a doctor, so I chose Biomedical Engineering, but after taking ENGR102, I realized I wanted to do computer science.
                So here I am.

                This is a test, if i can see this then it should work

            <p id = "main-paragraph"> This past summer, I worked for PricewaterhouseCoopers, also known as PwC. My role was considered a Data and Technology role
                which is not considered true computer science. I still used a lot of concepts I learned in my internship. Although I enjoyed my job, I want
                to transition into a more pure software engineering position. Also, another area that interests me is data science, which is why I am getting a minor
                in statistics. Some of my favorite courses have come from my minor. For fun, I like to play basketball with my mosque friends. Fun fact: I am traveling to
                Chicago this fall to play in a big tournament. Other things I enjoy to do is watch basketball, <a href = "https://www.nba.com/rockets" target = "_blank">Go Rockets !!!</a>, watching movies, building pretty legos, and watching Game of Thrones.

            <p id = "main-paragraph">Currently, I am involved in an organization called <a href = "https://fish.tamu.edu" target = "_blank">MSC FISH</a>, which is a social and service freshmen leadership organization striving to make a difference through service and hosting. I joined MSC FISH in my fresh
                man year, and now I am serving the executive team. A few of the things I help do are FLOBowl and Run the Ramps. FLOBowl is my favorite because we get to put on a HUGEEE powderpuff
                tournament for all the FLOs. It is always a blast seeing so many freshmen come together and have so much fun.
