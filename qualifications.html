                Some of programming langauges I have learned here at my time at Texas A&M University are <b style = "font-size: larger;">Python, C++, Java, Git, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AWS, Scheme, HDL.</b>
                These are all my technical skills but because I am involved in MSC Fish, I have learned a lot of leadership skills such as communication, teamwork, and organization. 
                MSC FISH strives itself on making better people in whole, and I have become a better friend and person as well. 
                <br><br>
                I am on track to graduate in 3 years which is alot shorter than most people, so I decided to earn my statistics minor. Getting my minor is one of my favorite things
                I have learned. Numbers surround our lives and I want to be able to understand them better. So with my intersection of statistics and computer science, I want to 
                become a data scientist. The beauty of data science is that it is a very broad field, so I can do a lot of things with it. For example, I can do work as a business analyst
                or even a software engineer. The possibilities are endless.
